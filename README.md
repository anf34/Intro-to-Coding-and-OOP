# Python-projects

## Class Blueprint:
A python program that takes as input class attributes and methods and generates a class which automatically writes test functions. This will significantly decrease time spent making classes. Eg, I am always making typos so a script that writes my classes for me quickly will help. Also automating test cases is always a plus. This project is definitely still a work in progress.
